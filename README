This is the Group Complete Android Client developed by Radical
Dynamic, also known as GC Mobile.  You can find the project website at
www.groupcomplete.com although there are no longer updates being made
to it.

Group Complete was an endeavour to create a truly mobile, robust and
powerful data collection & aggregation platform for Android.  It was
developed and supported from August 2010 until February 2012.  It is
based on the Open Data Kit project (opendatakit.org) and was the first
serious mobile project to use Apache CouchDB for Android.  

In late February 2012 a decision was made to abandon Group Complete.
This grew out of a change in direction at Radical and my desire to
pursue another career path.

While relatively stable, Apache CouchDB for Android is no longer
receiving significant attention and anyone considering using it should
consider alternatives such as TouchDB and friends.

I am making GC Mobile available to anyone who would like to study its
(sometimes convoluted) inner workings or adopt it for other projects.

Cheers,
